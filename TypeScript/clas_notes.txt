Interfaces
==========

    - if we know only declaration, but we don't know implentation then we will choose "interfaces".

    - implentation known by either "JSON", or "classes".

    - we will declare interfaces by using "interface" keyword.

    - we will provide implentation to interfaces by using "implements" keyword


NameSpaces
==========

    - logical grouping of similar functionalities called as NameSpace / module.

    - NameSpaces have "global scope".

    - NameSpaces also called as "external" modules.

    - we will declare NameSpaces by using "namespace" keyword..

    - we can import namespace by using following syntax.

    ///<ref path="file">



modules
=======
    - logical grouping of similar functionalities called as module.

    - modules have local scope.
